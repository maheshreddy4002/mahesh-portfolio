        I’m someone who’s always curious and passionate about learning new things — especially when it comes to cutting-edge technologies. 
        I have a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, and I’m fascinated by how they shape the digital world.
        My journey into tech has also led me to explore Full Stack Web Development, where I enjoy building clean, efficient, and impactful web applications.
        I believe in perfection — not just in results, but in the process too. I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and upgrading my skills — because I believe the best way to grow is by doing and staying curious.
